Define a `Playlist` class. It should have...
- A `title` (String) property that is determined by some input
- A `songs` (Array) property that is determined by some input. It should contain multiple songs, each of which can just be a song title (String).
- A `favorites` (Number) property that is initialized at 0. This cannot be set by user input.
- An `addSong` (Function) method that adds a song to the `songs` property

```js
class Playlist {
  constructor(title, songs){
    title: "Great Songs"
    songs: ["song1", "song2", "song3", "song4"]
    favorites:
  }
  addSong(){
