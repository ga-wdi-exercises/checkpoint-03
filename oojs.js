// Define a Playlist class. It should have...
  // A title property that is determined by some input.
  // A songs property that is determined by some input. It should contain multiple songs, each of which can just be a song title.
  // A favorites property that is initialized at 0. This cannot be set by user input.
  // An addSong method that adds a song to the songs property.

  class Playlist{
    constructor (title, song1, song2, song3){
      this.title = title;
      this.song = [song1 , song2, song3];
      this.favorites = 0
    }
      var addSong = function(song){
        this.song.push(song);
    };
  }

// Create an instance of the Playlist class.

  

// Create an Album class that inherits from Playlist. It should also...
  // Have an artist property that is determined by some input.

// Create an instance of the Album class.
