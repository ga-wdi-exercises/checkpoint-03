// Define a Playlist class. It should have...
  // A title property that is determined by some input.
  // A songs property that is determined by some input. It should contain multiple songs, each of which can just be a song title.
  // A favorites property that is initialized at 0. This cannot be set by user input.
  // An addSong method that adds a song to the songs property.

class Playlist {
  constructor(title, song) {
    this.title = title;
    this.song = [song];

    this.song.push(song);
  }
}


// Create an instance of the Playlist class.
const playlist = new Playlist("A", "B")

// Create an Album class that inherits from Playlist. It should also...
  // Have an artist property that is determined by some input.

class Album extends Playlist {
  constructor(title, song, artist){
    super(title, song);
    this.artist = artist;

// Create an instance of the Album class.
const alphabet = new Album("A", "B", "Alphabet")
